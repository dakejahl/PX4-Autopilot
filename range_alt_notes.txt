## FlightTaskManualAltitude
- dist_bottom_var -- currently terrain variance, I see occasionally dist_bottom diverge and then clamp back to expected
- ground slowdown (_respectGroundSlowdown) uses mpc_land_alt ... weird, remove?
- _respectMaxAltitude ... weird, remove? We can instead use dist_bottom validity
- _respectMinAltitude ... weird, remove? No need for a function


## FlightTask
- _dist_to_bottom and _dist_to_ground ... confusing, unify
-

## FlightTaskAuto
- reuse logic for range alt lock
- _prepareLandSetpoints -- Slow down automatic descend close to ground ... use only with terrain estimate available? (baro estimate unreliable)

## EKF
- Vz does not reflect true Vz due to noisy baro
- Vz errors cause rangefinder kinematic consistency check to fail
- Position setpoint error remains over long periods (might be related to Vz issues above)
